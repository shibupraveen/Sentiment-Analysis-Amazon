Amazon links customers with fantastic local businesses. In this article, we will concentrate on mobile phone brand reviews. We want to estimate a mobile phone's rating based on past information such as the title, and the Amazon user's feedback. We explore the data set made available by Kaggle. We will forecast the star(rating) of a review in this project. Logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision tree, ADA boosting, and naive Bayes model are used with sentiment analysis. After analyzing the performance of each model, the SVM algorithm was determined to be the best model for predicting ratings from reviews. In addition, we automated the model creation part in Python for computer efficiency which helps in saving time.
